Summary: This is the summary of the first post written for my Pelican blog.

##Big Heading for a big day!

This is the first paragraph of my article.

I am writing this in Markdown format so I can use two * symbols to indicate a **bold** formatted block of text.

###A slightly smaller header...

I can also use a single * around a block of text to indicate an *italicised* word. 

THE END! (Cool story :-])
